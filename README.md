# Aeromodelling Club Web Development

Welcome to the Aeromodelling Club Web Development project! This repository is dedicated to the development of our club's website.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a dynamic and user-friendly website for the Aeromodelling Club. The development is open to all club members who wish to contribute to enhancing the online presence of our club.

## Getting Started

Follow the guidelines below to set up your development environment and contribute to the project.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Git
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivam-043/Aero-Website-_-Temporary.git
```

## Installation

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd Aero-Website-_-Temporary
npm install
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Working Branch:**
   Ensure you are on the "main" branch before making any changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Create Your Development Branch:**
   Create a new branch with your name appended to "test-dev":
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-dev-yourname
   ```
3. **Make Changes:**
   Make necessary changes to the code, add, and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message here"
   ```
4. **Push Changes:**
   Push your changes to your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin test-dev-yourname
   ```
5. **Create a Pull Request:**
   After completing your feature or fix, it's time to integrate your changes into the main project. Follow these steps to create a pull request on GitHub:

   - Open your web browser and navigate to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Shivam-043/Aero-Website-_-Temporary).
   - Switch to your development branch using the branch dropdown menu.
   - Click on the "New Pull Request" button.
   - Set the base branch to "test-dev" and the compare branch to your development branch (e.g., "test-dev-yourname").
   - Review your changes and ensure the pull request title and description are clear and informative.
   - If everything looks good, click the "Create Pull Request" button.
   - Assign the pull request to relevant team members for review.
   - Once approved, the changes will be merged into the "test-dev" branch.

   **Note:** Ensure your pull request follows the contribution guidelines and addresses any conflicts that may arise during the review.

## Running the Project Locally

To view and test your changes locally, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Dependencies are Installed:**
   Before running the project, make sure you have installed the required dependencies. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal:

   ```bash
   cd Aero-Website-_-Temporary
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies with:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Project:**
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project locally. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start the development server, and you can access the project in your web browser at `http://localhost:your-chosen-port`. By default, the port is often set to 3000.

   Your changes will be reflected in real-time as you edit and save your code. If you encounter any issues, double-check your terminal for error messages and resolve them before proceeding.

3. **Testing:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:your-chosen-port` to interact with the locally running project. Test the functionalities and ensure that everything works as expected.

4. **Stopping the Local Server:**
   When you're done testing, you can stop the local server by going back to your terminal and pressing `Ctrl + C`.

Now you can develop, test, and refine your changes locally before pushing them to the main repository.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues running the project locally, check for error messages in the terminal and review the project documentation. If the problem persists, feel free to seek assistance from the development team.
